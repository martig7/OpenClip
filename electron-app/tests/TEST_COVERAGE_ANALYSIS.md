# Test Coverage Analysis

## Rating: 58 / 100

**Strengths:** Good multi-layer coverage (unit → API → component → integration → E2E), recording service is thorough, OBS has both mocked and real tests, path traversal security is covered, auto-updater is well-tested.

**Weaknesses dragging the score down:** Thin component tests, near-zero error recovery coverage, no concurrency tests, E2E duplication between files, missing entire categories (IPC layer, hotkeys, accessibility), and several API areas with only 2–6 tests.
